# 1. Week 1–2: Language Foundations

- [ ] Decide core features: variables, types, control flow, functions.

- [ ] Decide syntax style: Pythonic indentation? braces? hybrid?

- [ ] Decide data structures to support initially: list, dict, string, int, float.

- [ ] Make a feature wishlist: must-have vs nice-to-have.

# 2. Week 3–4: Grammar & Semantics

- [ ] Write the BNF/EBNF grammar for the core syntax.

- [ ] Define operator precedence & associativity.

- [ ] Decide scoping rules: global, local, closures?

- [ ] Think about runtime design: how functions/variables live in memory.

# 3. Week 5–6: Sample Programs

- [ ] Each of you writes 5–10 small programs that your language should run.

- [ ] Examples: calculator, small loops, function calls, conditional logic.

- [ ] Highlight syntax quirks and edge cases.

# 4. Week 7–8: Team Discussions

- [ ] Compare your ideas, refine inconsistencies.

- [ ] Prioritize features: core vs optional.

- [ ] Start mocking up AST examples on paper: how parsed code should look internally.

# 5. Week 9–10: Pre-C Tech Planning

- [ ] Decide whether to use pure C, or a small helper library (Flex/Bison for parser?).

- [ ] Decide module structure for the C implementation.

- [ ] Make a shared research doc + task tracker (Google Docs / Notion / Trello).
